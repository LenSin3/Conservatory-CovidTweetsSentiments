It is short, which I like.  (I don't need more than a couple of feet of cable coiled up on my desk.)  It charges well and doesn't give me the error.

My husband and my daughter both lost their original cables for their iPhones and they went the cheap route, buying a cheap replacement cable, I believe it messed up their battery memory because coincidentally both of them have battery hold/charge issues but my son and I do not. I used this cable to charge my husbands phone and it charged it from 3% to 100% in about an hour, that's about how long it takes my phone to charge but with the cheap cable his takes 2-1/2 hours. I'm thrilled with the quality of this cable, I'm hoping now that we have &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; cables again, maybe the battery memory will improve on their phones.  Great cable at a great price.

       "190913  This one actually works unlike some others I bought I get error msg saying this is unauthorized will not charge. This feels durable and not some flimsy garbage wire. The best part of this wire is, it is long enough for it to be plugged in and I can actually still use my phone while its charging since the wire is long enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "190914  I don't like the word \"hate\", so let's just say that there are two things that I *can't stand*.1)  I can't stand paying full price for an Apple Lightning cable.2)  I can't stand getting the message that this cable is not compatible with your device message.This cable is fantastic.  It is short, which I like.  (I don't need more than a couple of feet of cable coiled up on my desk.)  It charges well and doesn't give me the error.  Hooray!I like the black color of the cable and I like the nice substantial PVC coating.  This cable feels very sturdy and I'm confident that it won't fall apart like some of my other generic cables.  I suppose that with a name like Liger, how could you go wrong?  (Napoleon Dynamite would approve.)I was provided this item for review.  \n",

       "190917  This is a great cable, just as good as the more expensive Apple one. My husband and my daughter both lost their original cables for their iPhones and they went the cheap route, buying a cheap replacement cable, I believe it messed up their battery memory because coincidentally both of them have battery hold/charge issues but my son and I do not. I used this cable to charge my husbands phone and it charged it from 3% to 100% in about an hour, that's about how long it takes my phone to charge but with the cheap cable his takes 2-1/2 hours. I'm thrilled with the quality of this cable, I'm hoping now that we have &#34;quality&#34; cables again, maybe the battery memory will improve on their phones.  Great cable at a great price. I definitely recommend.           \n",
